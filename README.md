# xbee â€” XBee measurement & mobile-node localization (project showcase)

This repository is a compact showcase of my XBee-based measurement and localization project. It contains MATLAB scripts, example CSV datasets, and a short report / Live Script that demonstrate how I read XBee measurement logs, compute distances, and estimate mobile-node positions.
